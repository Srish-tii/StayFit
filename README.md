## Chosen Track: AI/ML
Good health is one of the key influencers to leading a perfect life. Maintaining good health is critical for everyone, especially which anyone has a chance of getting coronary heart disease or heart attack
Hence, we are trying to develop an AI driven application that can predict the risk of heart diseases/ heart attack.

## Problem Statement
Health care: Check Heart attack possibility
About data set
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date.The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no/less chance of heart attack and 1 = more chance of heart attack.

## The problem StayFit solves
To develop an ML model using the Cleveland Database to predict the risk of heart diseases/ heart attack. People can use our website to understand if they are at a high or low risk of facing heart attack and take steps accordingly to prevent it and maintain healthy lifestyle.

Good health is one of the key influencers to leading a perfect life. Maintaining good health is critical for everyone, especially which anyone has a chance of getting coronary heart disease or heart attack
Hence, we are trying to develop an AI driven application that can predict the risk of heart diseases/ heart attack.

## Challenges we ran into
Low accuracy, increasing it was a challenge but we were able to do it.
Integrating the Machine Learning models in the web application was another huge task for us but at the end we could do it.
